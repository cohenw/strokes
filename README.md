# Strokes
**Achievements for Visual Studio .NET 2010**

**Important information:** In order to run the project from code, please read the [Wiki Page] (https://github.com/jonasswiatek/strokes/wiki).

**MORE IMPORTANT INFORMATION:** If you want to try the current alpha-quality releases, remember to use the "Strokes Achievement Project"-template (located in the Visual C# Category in the New Project Dialog of Visual Studio)

This Visual Studio Extension strives to provide a tool for teaching C# to beginners and give experienced programmers an opportunity to catch up with all the features of the C# programming language.

This project is currently in a beta stage, and you can download a copy from the downloads section here on github. This extension is a proper Visual Studio 2010 extension, so it is easily removed with visual studios extension management features. The only data this extension writes to your hard drive (except for it's assemblies deployed by the VSIX installer), is a small XML file in your AppData Directory that contains which achievements you've unlocked.
